the option to install macos is gone. 
tried with sonoma 14.5 both with an iso and the mac installer but neither would boot. 
recent broadcom and vmware articles indicate support to 14. 
broadcom since made fusion free after revoking open source esxi.
something is not quite right.

i have used fusion and parallels the past and both worked well.
maybe 14.5 is a half version too new and support is coming. (26 JUNE 2024)
